# AFib-Wave-Synthesis-Generating-Realistic-Atrial-Fibrillation-ECG-Signals-Using-GAN
This repository contains a GAN model that synthesizes realistic Atrial Fibrillation (AF) ECG waveforms, characterized by the absence of P waves. The generated ECG signals can be used for research, training, and testing ECG analysis algorithms, particularly for detecting Atrial Fibrillation.
